# PRIYESH N D –  Senior Fullstack Mobile + Web Developer 🚀

I build reliable, scalable, and maintainable software across web, mobile, and backend.  
I take complete ownership of what I work on — from architecture to deployment — and make sure it runs exactly as expected.  
My code isn’t just functional — it’s built to last.

I work with intent, clarity, and a strong bias for action.
